### About me 
I'm Unknown People, somebody who's trying to get through this crazy world while discovering new things everyday. I'm a student, but my interests and goals are much larger than just code. **I am passionate about creating a positive impact in the world**, and code is just one avenue that I use to achieve that. 

### Quick Facts ⏩

* 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
* ⚡ Fun Fact: I function on caffeine :coffee: and smoking 🚬
* 🔭 Website: Portfolio

#### Code Graveyard Disclaimer ☠️

Just a quick disclaimer! My github profile is mostly graveyard projects from college. Feel free to look around - but remember that **much of this code was written when I was just a student**. Most of my newer code is proprietary (for the moment) so I can't really share it, I'm working towards updating this profile and contribute to opensource.

### 📫 Say Hi:   

To be honest, the best way to contact me is probably via Direct Messages on one of my social accounts. We can talk about technology, food, music, drinks, or anything really good and geeky! I enjoy sharing my experiences, but I prefer to hear other people's personal journeys and opinions.
